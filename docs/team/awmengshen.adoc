== PROJECT: TaskBook

---

== Overview

*TaskBook* is a desktop task manager application that is designed for students. It allows users to keep track of the
progress of their active tasks and manage their workload accordingly. The goal of *TaskBook* is to improve the
userâ€™s productivity through efficient task management. *TaskBook* is optimized for students who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section summarises my contributions to the project. These contributions range from simple, minor enhancements
to complex, major enhancements._

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the option to *add multiple milestones a selected task*.
** What it does: It allows the user to split up a huge task into smaller, manageable subtasks called milestones.
** Justification: This feature will allow the user to ensure that he/she is on track to complete the task by hitting
each milestone specified by the user. It enables the user to better manage his time and resources by splitting a task up.
** Highlights:


* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented a sort function for each task such that the milestones for each task are
sorted by their ranks.
